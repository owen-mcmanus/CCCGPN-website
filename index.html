            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to preserve and advocate for historical geographic place names across California. Through dedicated research, public awareness campaigns, and policy advocacy, we ensure that history is not erased from our maps.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content" id="projects">
            <h2>Our Projects</h2>
            <p>CCCGPN has worked on numerous projects to safeguard historical place names. Some of our notable initiatives include:</p>
            
            <div class="project">
                <h3>The Sierra Heritage Mapping Project</h3>
                <img src="sierra_project.jpg" alt="Sierra Nevada Mountains">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Sierra Nevada</p>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify and protect indigenous and pioneer-era place names.</p>
                <p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborated with local tribal leaders to document native names. We conducted in-depth interviews with tribal elders, gathering stories and meanings behind traditional place names. This information was compiled into a comprehensive digital archive to ensure accessibility for future generations.</li>
                    <li>Advocated for official recognition of historic names. Through petitions and presentations to state and federal naming boards, we successfully restored multiple indigenous names to official maps, ensuring their cultural significance is preserved.</li>
                    <li>Published an educational guide on the origins of Sierra Nevada place names. This guide, distributed to schools and libraries, details the linguistic and historical evolution of geographic names in the region, fostering awareness and appreciation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Coastal Names Restoration</h3>
                <img src="coastal_project.jpeg" alt="California Coastline">
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Central and Northern California Coast</p>
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Restore names of historical significance along California’s coast.</p>
                <p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked with local governments to restore Spanish and indigenous place names. We provided historical research demonstrating the authenticity of these names and gained municipal approval for renaming several landmarks to reflect their original identities.</li>
                    <li>Hosted public forums to discuss place-name heritage. These events brought together historians, linguists, and community members to share perspectives on the importance of preserving culturally significant names.</li>
                    <li>Petitioned for historical plaques recognizing restored names. In collaboration with local heritage organizations, we installed plaques at key locations, providing historical context and enriching public understanding.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Public Education Campaigns</h3>
                <img src="education_project.jpg" alt="Educational Workshop">
                <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Raise awareness about the importance of geographic names.</p>
                <p><strong>Actions Taken:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Organized town halls discussing place-name history. These forums allowed community members to voice concerns over name changes, learn about historical contexts, and engage with experts on naming traditions.</li>
                    <li>Developed an interactive map showcasing historical name changes. This online resource enables users to explore the evolution of place names in California, providing historical insights and educational value.</li>
                    <li>Produced a documentary on California's geographic names. Featuring expert interviews and historical footage, this documentary has been screened at schools, museums, and public events to educate audiences on the significance of preserving place names.</li>

        <div class="content" id="advocacy">
            <h2>Advocacy</h2>
            <p>CCCGPN is actively involved in policy discussions regarding place name preservation. We work with historians, legislators, and local communities to prevent unnecessary renaming and to educate the public on the cultural importance of geographic names.</p>
            <p>Our advocacy efforts have reached multiple levels of government, ensuring that place name preservation remains a priority. CCCGPN has testified before the California State Assembly and Senate committees, presenting research on the historical and cultural significance of geographic names. We have successfully lobbied for legislative measures that provide protections for historical place names and prevent arbitrary renaming.</p>
            <p>At the federal level, CCCGPN has engaged with the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN), providing detailed reports and historical evidence to support the retention and restoration of indigenous and historically significant names. Our collaboration with USBGN has led to the formal recognition of several historical names that were in danger of being replaced. We have also played an instrumental role in advising federal agencies on best practices for name preservation.</p>
            <p>CCCGPN has worked closely with the National Park Service to implement educational initiatives highlighting the importance of preserving geographic heritage. We have assisted in the development of interpretive materials for national parks, ensuring that visitors understand the deep historical roots behind place names.</p>
            <p>Beyond legislative work, we have organized large-scale public awareness campaigns, including digital petitions, letter-writing campaigns, and grassroots organizing efforts. These initiatives have led to direct policy changes, including the reinstatement of several historic place names that were previously at risk of being erased.</p>
            <p>Our outreach efforts include partnerships with universities, museums, and historical societies to promote research and education on geographic naming conventions. We regularly host symposia and conferences that bring together scholars, policymakers, and activists to discuss the significance of place names and strategies for their protection.</p>
            <p>Through persistent advocacy, CCCGPN has helped shape public policy, influence government decisions, and foster a greater appreciation for the historical and cultural significance of California’s place names.</p>
